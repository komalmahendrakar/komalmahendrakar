# Hey, I'm Komal 👋

I'm a full-stack developer, comfortable with the MERN stack and always open to learning more.  
I enjoy crafting responsive, clean, and intuitive web apps — and adding a little motion with GSAP never hurts.

### 🛠️ What I work with
- 💻 **MERN Stack** – MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
- ⚡ **Tailwind + Vite** – for fast, scalable frontend setups
- 🎞️ **GSAP** – for scroll animations and interaction magic
- 🔗 REST APIs, routing, auth, and deployment

### 🚧 Currently exploring
-🔍 Advanced backend architecture – layered patterns, modular design, and clean code principles
- 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java – focusing on real-world problem solving and coding interviews
- 🌐 System design fundamentals – designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs.
- 🤖 Generative AI – exploring how LLMs work, building small prototypes using open models 


**Always learning. Always building.**
